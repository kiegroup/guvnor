  <title>REST API</title>

  <para>The repository back end can also be accessed via Rest. Rest is a http
  based protocol API - which has clients on all platforms and in all
  programming languages.</para>

  <section>
    <title>REST</title>

    <para>Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software
    architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide
    Web. The term Representational State Transfer was introduced and defined
    in 2000 by <link
    xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy Fielding</link>
    in his doctoral dissertation.</para>

    <para>REST-style architectures consist of clients and servers. Clients
    initiate requests to servers; servers process requests and return
    appropriate responses. Requests and responses are built around the
    transfer of representations of resources. A resource can be essentially
    any coherent and meaningful concept that may be addressed. A
    representation of a resource is typically a document that captures the
    current or intended state of a resource. the REST protocol is often
    considered as a light protocol versus SOAP</para>

    <title>Guvnor REST API</title>

    <para>The Guvnor Rest API is divided in two groups of services : one
    around accessing rule assets by their names and packages and the second 
    accessing rule assets by categories.</para>

    <para>A rule asset represents all elements that can be stored and handled
    in Guvnor : a guided rule, a web decision table, a test scenario,
    etc.</para>

    <para>The http address to use as base address is
    http://{ServerName}/{httpPort}/{drools-Guvnor}/rest where ServerName is
    the host name on the server on which Guvnor is deployed, httpPort the port
    number (8080 by default development), drools-guvnor the name of the
    archived deployed (guvnor-webapp-5.3.0 for version 5.3.0).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting rule Assets by Category</title>

      <para>This part of the API uses as entry point the categories defined
      for each rule asset when it is created by the user in Guvnor</para>

    <title>Source code Example</title>

    <para>We are giving a list of example to help using the Guvnor's Rest
    API</para>

    <section>
      <title>Retrieving and updating Web decision table</title>

      <para>We are using apache CXF in our example to show how to access the
      Rest API of Guvnor. In the example here we are getting and updating a
      web decision table. But this example applies to all Guvnor asset
      type.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Retrieving the source code of the web decision table</title>

        <programlisting>WebClient client = WebClient.create("http://127.0.0.1:8080/");
String content=client.path("guvnor-webapp-${project.version}/rest/packages/essaiRest/assets/tab2/source").accept("text/plain").get(String.class);
GuidedDecisionTable52 dt = GuidedDTXMLPersistence.getInstance().unmarshal(content);        </programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>In the first line of code above, we are first creating a WebClient
      variable that points to the server (here on localhost on port
      8080).</para>

      <para>In the second line of code above, we are retrieving the source
      content by accessing the
      /rest/packages/{packageName}/assets/{assetName}/source where i our case
      packageName is "essaiRest" and assetName is "tab2".</para>

      <para>In the third line of code above, the source code we get is the
      data structure of a Web decision table. So to be able to manipulate the
      Web decision table, we have to transform the string variable (the source
      code that contains the xml of the data structure of the web decision
      table) in the java structure (a java class) for web decision table
      GuidedDecisionTable52. All guided asset in Guvnor have a java structure
      to manipulate them</para>

      <example>
        <title>updating the source code of the web decision table</title>

        <programlisting>String authorizationHeader = "Basic " + org.apache.cxf.common.util.Base64Utility.encode("guest:".getBytes());
GuidedDecisionTable52 dt = new GuidedDecisionTable52();
.. 
Do some stuff here
..
String newContent = GuidedDTXMLPersistence.getInstance().marshal(dt);
WebClient client2 = WebClient.create("http://127.0.0.1:8080/");
client2.header("Authorization", authorizationHeader);
Response response= client2.path("guvnor-webapp-${project.version}/rest/packages/essaiRest/assets/tab2/source").accept("application/xml").put(newContent);        </programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>In the first line of code above, we are first creating a java
      String variable that contains the authorization element needed to update
      an asset on the Guvnor repository.</para>

      <para>In the next lines of code above, we are doing some stuff to modify
      the Web decision table.</para>

      <para>In the following lines of code above, we are first transforming
      the java structure in an xml structure that we put in a java String
      variable. Then we again create a WebClient but this time we are also
      filling the header with a variable "Authorization" that contains the
      String we built in the first line and that contains the user name
      "guest" and its password (here no password). We then put the new content
      on the Guvnor repository.</para>

      <para>Next you can find the pom.xml file to use the Guvnor Rest API in
      case you are using Maven.</para>

      <example>
