   <title>Database configuration</title>

   <para>
   Guvnor uses the JCR standard for storing assets such as rules. The default implementation is Apache
   Jackrabbit, <ulink url="http://jackrabbit.apache.org" />. This includes an out of the box storage
   engine/database, which you can use as is, or configure to use an existing RDBMS if needed.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Changing the location of the data store</title>

      <para>
      Assuming you are using on of the JBoss platforms, running Guvnor for the first time will create a
      database in the <filename>bin/</filename> directory of the application server. There you will find 
      the default Jackrabbit configuration file, namely <filename>repository.xml</filename>, and a 
      <filename>repository</filename> directory which contains your repository data. Both of these are 
      created automatically for you.
      </para>

      <para>
      The location of the data store should be a secure location, that is backed up. The default location may
      not be suitable for this, so the easiest way is to set a more suitable location. If you want to change
      this, please make sure you have stopped Guvnor (i.e. stopped the app server or un-deployed the
      application).
      </para>

      <para>
      To change the location, unzip the Guvnor WAR file, and locate the <filename>beans.xml</filename> file in
      the <filename>WEB-INF/classes/META-INF</filename> directory. This is a JBoss Seam configuration file (Seam 3 is the
      framework used) which allows various parts of the system to be customized. When you have located the
      <filename>beans.xml</filename> file, you should see something like the following:
      </para>

      <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[  <guvnorRepository:GuvnorBootstrapConfiguration>
    <s:modifies/>

    <!-- JackRabbit  -->
    <guvnorRepository:properties>
      <s:entry><s:key>org.drools.repository.configurator</s:key><s:value>org.drools.repository.jackrabbit.JackrabbitRepositoryConfigurator</s:value></s:entry>
      <!--  the root directory for the repo storage the directory must exist. -->
      <!--<s:entry><s:key>repository.root.directory</s:key><s:value>/opt/yourpath</s:value></s:entry>-->
    </guvnorRepository:properties>

    ...
  </guvnorRepository:GuvnorBootstrapConfiguration>]]></programlisting>

      <para>Find the component with a name of <literal>GuvnorBootstrapConfiguration</literal> and its section for JackRabbit configuration,
      then the key property with the name of <literal>repository.root.directory</literal>.</para>

      <para>If you un-comment this key element (as in the example above it is commented
      out), you can set whatever file-system path you need for the repository data to be
      stored in. You can also use this to move the repository around. In that
      case, when you have set the location in the <filename>beans.xml</filename> you can
      simply move the <filename>repository.xml</filename> AND the repository directory to the new
      location that you set in the <filename>beans.xml</filename>.</para>

      <para>If there is no repository.xml configuration file, or the repository directory at the location 
      specified (or in the default location) then Guvnor will create new empty ones.</para>

      <para>There are many more options which can be configured in the
      <filename>repository.xml</filename>, but for the most part, it is not recommended to change
      the defaults.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Configuring Guvnor to use an external RDBMS</title>

      <para>
      In some cases it may be a requirement that you use an external RDBMS, such as Oracle, MySQL, or
      Microsoft SQL Server as the data store - this is permitted and recommended as storing your repository data in an 
      external RDBMS is much more reliable than the default file-system storage option. The JackRabbit <filename>repository.xml</filename>
      file contains the information where your repository data is stored, so changes to this file are necessary for 
      RDBMS setup. You have two options to make changes to <filename>repository.xml</filename>, namely make all changes
      manually, or use the Guvnor Repository Configuration Manager.</para>
      
      <para>If you opt for the manual configuration, the easiest thing
      to do is to start up Guvnor with defaults (or with a suitable repository.root.directory directory as specified above) 
      to let it generate the default <filename>repository.xml</filename>. Locate the <filename>repository.xml</filename>
      file that was generated, and open it -
      it will be annotated with comments describing many of the different
      options. From here on, you will need to know a little about Jackrabbit
      Persistence managers, <ulink url="http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/PersistenceManagerFAQ" />.
      There are a few persistence managers, some are database specific
      (eg Oracle). There is a SimpleDBPersistenceManager which works with any
      database that supports JDBC - you also specify the database type, so it
      uses the specific DDL to create the table structure (all major databases
      are supported).After you have added your configuraiton options, start the Guvnor application again. Guvnor will 
      then create the database tables the first time it is started up if
      it is running against a fresh (empty) RDBMS - so its important to note
      that the user credentials supplied have permissions to create tables (at
      least initially, on first run, after that they could be locked
      down).</para>
      
      <para>Using the Repository Configuration Manager in Guvnor is often a lot easier and a less error-prone options
      to make the necessary configuration changes in <filename>repository.xml</filename>. With Guvnor application running,
      select the Administration tab in the left-hand-side navigation bar, then select the Repository Configuration link.</para>

      <para>Repository Configuration Manager includes template configuration files for many external RDBMS types. The 
      first thing you have to do is the select the RDBMS type from the dropdown menu and select if you are using JNDI to 
      look up your data source or not.</para>

    <para>You can download the generated <filename>repository.xml</filename> file by clicking the "Save Configuration"
    button, or copy/paste the generated text manually. Replace your existing <filename>repository.xml</filename> with
    the generated one and restart Guvnor for the changes to get picked up.</para>

      <title>Searching and indexing, Version storage</title>

      <para>Jackrabbit has a separate storage area for version storage (as
      over time, the number of old versions will increase, yet it should not
      slow down the performance of the main data store). The version storage
      also has its own persistence manage configuration in the <filename>repository.xml</filename>,
      but for most purposes you can use the same database as the main storage
      (just with a different schema object prefix - ie in your database, all
      the version data will be prefixed with <literal>version_</literal> but otherwise in the
      same tablespace). See the <filename>repository.xml</filename> for more details of
      this.</para>

      <para>Lucene is used to provide indexing across the semi structured
      data, and across versions. This indexing is generally best stored on a
      filesystem, local to Guvnor (as per the default in the <filename>repository.xml</filename>) -
      in most cases the default is fine.</para>
