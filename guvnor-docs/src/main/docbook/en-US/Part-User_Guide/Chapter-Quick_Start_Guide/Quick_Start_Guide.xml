  <title>Quick start guide</title>

  <para>If you are reading this, you must be the impatient type who wants to
  kick the tires (and light the fires) and have a look around as soon as
  possible. This section will provide a quick end to end tour of the steps
  involved (but does not go through the concepts in detail). This assumes you
  have installed the repository correctly, and are able to access the main
  login screen.</para>

  <para>You can also consult the <link
  xlink:href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=RulesRepository">wiki</link>
  for some tutorials and user tips (it IS a wiki, so you can even contribute
  your own tips and examples and even upload files if you desire !).</para>

    <title>Supported browser platforms</title>

    <para>The supported server side platforms are mentioned in the
    installation guide. For browsers - the major ones are supported, this
    includes Firefox (1.5 and up), IE7 and up, Opera, Safari, Google Chrome
    etc. The preferred browser for most platforms is firefox, it is widely
    available and free, if you have any choice at all, Firefox is the
    preferred platform, followed by safari on mac. IE6 users can experience
    some poor performance, and as this is a dangerously insecure browser IE7
    or a superior browser (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is
    recommended.</para>

    <title>Initial configuration</title>

    <para>Some initial setup is required the first time. The first time the
    server starts up, it will create an empty repository, then take the
    following steps:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Once deployed, go to <link
        xlink:href="http://localhost:8080/guvnor-webapp/">http://localhost:8080/guvnor-webapp/</link>
        This will show the initial info screen or login screen depending on
        the configuration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If it is a brand new repository, you will want to go to "Admin",
        and choose "Manage Categories"</para>

        <para>(Add a few categories of your choosing, categories are only for
        classification, not for execution or anything else.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Rules need a fact model (object model) to work off, so next you
        will want to go to the Package management feature. From here you can
        click on the icon to create a new package (give it a meaningful name,
        with no spaces).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>To upload a model, use a JAR which has the fact model (API) that
        you will be using in your rules and your code (go and make one now if
        you need to !). When you are in the model editor screen, you can
        upload a JAR file, choose the package name from the list that you
        created in the previous step.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Now edit your package configuration (you just created) to import
        the fact types you just uploaded (add import statements), and save the
        changes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>At this point, the package is configured and ready to go (you
        generally won't have to go through that step very often).</para>

        <para>(Note that you can also import an existing DRL package - it will
        store the rules in the repository as individual assets).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Writing some rules</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Once you have at least one category and one package setup, you
        can author rules.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>There are multiple rule "formats", but from the Guvnor point of
        view, they are all "assets".</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You create a rule by clicking the icon with the rules logo (the
        head), and from that you enter a name.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You will also have to choose one category. Categories provide a
        way of viewing rules that is separate to packages (and you can make
        rules appear in multiple packages) - think of it like tagging.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Chose the "Business rule (guided editor)" formats.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>This will open a rule modeler, which is a guided editor. You can
        add and edit conditions and actions based on the model that is in use
        in the current package. Also, any DSL sentence templates setup for the
        package will be available.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When you are done with rule editing, you can check in the
        changes (save), or you can validate or "view source" (for the
        effective source).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You can also add/remove categories from the rule editor, and
        other attributes such as documentation (if you aren't sure what to do,
        write a document in natural language describing the rule, and check it
        in, that can also serve as a template later)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Finding stuff</title>

    <para>In terms of navigating, you can either use the Rules feature, which
    shows things grouped by categories, or you can use the Package feature,
    and view by package (and rule type). If you know the name or part of the
    name of an asset, you can also use the "Quick find", start typing a rule
    name and it will return a list of matches as you type (so if you have a
    sensible naming scheme, it will make it very quick to find stuff).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Deployment</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>After you have edited some rules in a package, you can click on
        the package feature, open the package that you wish, and build the
        whole package.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If that succeeds, then you will be able to download a binary
        package file which can be deployed into a runtime system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You can also take a "snapshot" of a package for deployment. This
        freezes the package at that point in time, so any concurrent changes
        to not effect the package. It also makes the package available on a
        URL of the form: "http://&lt;your
        server&gt;/guvnor-webapp/org.drools.guvnor.Guvnor/packages/&lt;packageName&gt;/&lt;snapshotName&gt;"
        (where you can use that URL and downloads will be covered in the
        section on deployment).</para>
