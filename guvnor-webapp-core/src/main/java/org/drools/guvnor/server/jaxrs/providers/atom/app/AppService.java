/**
 * <p>
 * Per RFC 5023:
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * The root of a Service Document is the "app:service" element.
 * 
 * The app:service element is the container for service information
 * associated with one or more Workspaces.  An app:service element MUST
 * contain one or more app:workspace elements.
 * 
 * namespace app = "http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
 * start = appService
 * 
 * appService =
 *    element app:service {
 *        appCommonAttributes,
 *       ( appWorkspace+
 *         & extensionElement* )
 *    }
 * <p/>
 * For authoring to commence, a client needs to discover the
 * capabilities and locations of the available Collections.  Service
 * Documents are designed to support this discovery process.
 * 
 * How Service Documents are discovered is not defined in this
 * specification. 
 * 
 * Service Documents are identified with the "application/atomsvc+xml"
 * media type
 * </pre>
